    "In your previous coursework, you have explored a variety of supervised and unsupervised data mining models. You have seen the power of using data analytical techniques to help organizations make data-driven decisions and now want to extend these models into areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this course, you will explore the use of neural networks and natural language processing (NLP).\n",

    "Tokenization helps give greater accuracy to words by analyzing the sequence of words and frequent items that repeat. The process separates our reviews into individual words an lemmas. Lemmas help get the root meaning of the word, but removing prefixes, suffixes to a form that is easily understood by the algorthimn to classify. It is removing noise. In the following section, we will be converting text into numerical form and encoding it into integers. \n",

    "* embedding_dim: individual words to be embedded into 16 dimensions\n",

The focus was to determine wether or not the model could accurately classify the sentiment as negative or positive, using a NLP neural network. The model was built with four layers using a sequential model.The results of the NLP model are substandard. The model cannot be used in any sort of recommender system or application, since its accuracy is very low. "

    "\n",
    "Given the low accuracy of the model at 51.68%, it is inadvisable to use it in any sort of application until it is raised above 75%. Specifically, we may have to retrain the model with labeled datasets that are closer to the products in the model. Specifically, it may be useful to use data from an ecommerce business similar to Amazon, or reviews from similar products. It would be useful to use similar Amazon products, or even different website reviewes to train the NLP model. Movie reviews and resturaunt review patterns and stop words, as well as their patterns may be different that ecommerce products. This includes possibly different stop words and a entirely different corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "This model may be mixing irrelevant sentiment data to the amazon reviews, which is causing noise, and lowering the accuracy of the model. Neural networks are prone to exponential failures if the quality of the data being used is not properly labeled or segemented prior to use. "
